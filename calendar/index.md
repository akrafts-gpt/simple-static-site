We start with a calendar you’ll actually love, powered by community contributions and intelligent AI, all designed to get you **out** of your phone and **into** the real world.

This overview introduces the core vision and links to nine deep-dive articles that explore each piece of the puzzle in detail.

## 📑 Series Contents

1. [Who We’re Building For: Traveler & After-Work Explorer Personas](./personas/)
   Discover the two primary user groups—weekend hosts showing friends around and busy office workers seeking post-work plans. We’ll unpack their motivations, pain points, and decision-making processes, complete with day-in-the-life user journeys and illustrative scenarios.

2. [A Calendar You’ll Actually Love: Designing the Calendar-First UI](./calendar-ui/)
   Dive into our simplified, zoomable calendar interface that balances a high-level overview with detailed daily views. This article includes wireframes, interaction patterns (swipe cards, tile grids, story-style snippets), and the UX principles guiding each design choice.

3. [Mood as Your Map: From “Relaxed” to “Energized”](./moods/)
   Learn how we translate a warm-to-cool spectrum of moods—relaxation, exploration, focus, activity—into a visual heat-map that shows your month at a glance. We’ll cover color mappings, mood category definitions, and examples of how this guides healthier, more balanced planning.

4. [Inbox → Insight: Email Forwarding & LLM-Powered Event Extraction](./email-llm/)
   See how a simple “forward-to-service” workflow turns event emails into structured calendar suggestions while preserving privacy. You’ll get a behind-the-scenes look at our LLM parsing pipeline, schema mapping (title, time, venue, category, image), and before/after email samples.

5. [Building the World’s Event Wiki: Community Contributions & Curation](./community/)
   Explore our wiki-style repository model where users, bloggers, and moderators collaborate to keep event data fresh and accurate. We’ll detail contributor roles, moderation tools, upvote/rating mechanics, and gamification elements like badges and “trusted source” flags.

6. [Smart Suggestions: Personalization & Chained Event Recommendations](./smart-suggestions/)
   Unpack the algorithms behind our location-aware, behavior-driven ranking system. From filtering by popularity and past interest to chaining sequences (e.g., drinks → concert → late-night stroll), we’ll illustrate real user flows and the data signals that power each suggestion.

7. [Staying Out, Not Stuck In: Integrations & Non-Intrusive Reminders](./integrations/)
   Learn how one-tap exports to Google/Apple Calendars and “only when it matters” alerts (cancellations, time changes) keep you on schedule without cluttering your screen. We’ll share integration workflows, API considerations, and UX mockups for light-touch reminders.

8. [Money Moves & Future Features: Ticket Sales, Exchanges & Beyond](./ticketing/)
   Map out our monetization roadmap—from affiliate ticket sales to a community-driven exchange platform inspired by TicketSwap. This piece will cover potential partnership models, secure transaction frameworks, and a timeline for in-app ticketing and user-created events.

9. [Where We Stand: Market Landscape & Competitive Analysis](./market-analysis/)
   Survey the current ecosystem—Google/Apple Calendars, Facebook Events, Meetup, Resident Advisor—and pinpoint our unique value proposition. We’ll present competitor feature matrices, SWOT insights, market sizing, and go-to-market strategies tailored by region.
