# Money Moves & Future Features: Ticket Sales, Exchanges & Beyond

While our app starts as a purely planning tool, a robust ticketing ecosystem is a natural next step. In this article, we outline a phased roadmap for monetization, community-driven exchanges, and eventual in-app ticket sales and event creation.

## 1. Affiliate Ticket Partnerships  
- **Commission Model:** Embed links to trusted ticket vendors (e.g., Ticketmaster, Eventbrite) and earn a percentage of each sale.  
- **Seamless Checkout:** Open purchase flows in-app via webviews or partner SDKs, minimizing friction.  
- **Curated Offers:** Highlight special deals or early-bird pricing for premium users or subscribers.

## 2. Community-Driven Ticket Exchange  
- **Secure Resale Platform:** Inspired by TicketSwap, allow users to list tickets at face value or capped markup.  
- **Escrow & Verification:** Hold payments in escrow until ticket transfer is confirmed, using digital transfer or QR-code validation.  
- **Reputation & Ratings:** Build trust with seller ratings, transaction histories, and community feedback loops.

## 3. In-App Ticketing & Event Creation  
- **Native Sales Integration:** Partner with payment gateways (Stripe, Adyen) to support direct ticket purchases inside the app.  
- **User-Generated Events:** Empower hosts and small organizers to create event listings, sell tickets, and manage RSVPs without external tools.  
- **Dynamic Inventory & Pricing:** Support tiered pricing, discount codes, and real-time seat availability.

## 4. Monetization & Premium Tiers  
- **Subscription Benefits:** Offer a premium plan that waives service fees on purchases or grants early access to popular events.  
- **Sponsored Highlights:** Allow venues to promote select events in curated feeds, clearly labeled as sponsored content.  
- **Data Insights for Partners:** Provide anonymized trend reports (e.g., demand heat-maps) to venues and promoters on a subscription basis.

## 5. Roadmap & Milestones  
| Phase                   | Features                                    | Timeline       |

By layering these features over time, we create a sustainable revenue model while maintaining community trust and keeping the core planning experience free and frictionless.
