# Building the World’s Event Wiki: Community Contributions & Curation

To keep our event database fresh, accurate, and inclusive, we’ve adopted a wiki-style model where community members play key roles in contributing and curating content.

## Community Roles & Governance

- **Contributors**  
  Any registered user can submit or edit event entries—adding details like descriptions, images, and tags.  
- **Moderators**  
  Trusted volunteers review submissions for accuracy and appropriateness, resolving conflicts and handling spam.  
- **Power-Users**  
  Highly engaged members earn elevated privileges (e.g., bulk edits, batch imports) after demonstrating consistent, high-quality contributions.  
- **Blogger & Influencer Partners**  
  Selected local voices (food bloggers, cultural critics) can publish curated collections, driving discovery and credibility.

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Submit or Edit an Event**  
   Fill out a simple form with fields for title, date/time, venue, category, and optional media.  
2. **Peer Review**  
   Submissions enter a review queue; moderators and power-users vet details within 24 hours.  
3. **Approval & Publishing**  
   Once verified, the event appears in the public database and becomes available for recommendations.

## Moderation & Quality Control

- **Upvotes & Flags**  
  Users can upvote trusted entries; flags trigger moderator review for inaccuracies or irrelevance.  
- **Revision History**  
  Every edit is tracked, allowing rollbacks to previous versions and transparent change logs.  
- **Trusted Source Badges**  
  Events added by official venues or high-reputation contributors get a badge to signal reliability.

## Gamification & Incentives

- **Badges & Reputation**  
  Earn badges (e.g., “First Fifty Edits,” “Top Curator”) and reputation points for approved contributions.  
- **Leaderboards & Challenges**  
  Monthly challenges (e.g., “Add 10 Hidden Gems”) encourage friendly competition and deeper coverage.  
- **Community Recognition**  
  Highlight top contributors in a “Hall of Fame” section and feature influencer-created collections on the homepage.

## Partner Integrations

- **Local Blogger Spotlights**  
  Invite curated blogging partners to publish themed guides (e.g., “Summer Street Food Tour”) directly into the database.  
- **Venue & Organizer Feeds**  
  Offer optional RSS or API endpoints for venues to push updates, ensuring official event details are always current.

By empowering users, trusted moderators, and local influencers, our wiki approach scales coverage while maintaining high data quality—making us the go-to source for what’s happening around town.
