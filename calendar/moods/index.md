# Mood as Your Map: From “Relaxed” to “Energized”

People don’t just seek events—they seek experiences that match their energy and mindset. That’s why we’ve mapped moods onto a warm-to-cool spectrum, letting you plan with intention and balance.

## The Mood Spectrum

- **Relax & Chill (Warmest)**  
  Low-energy, restorative activities—think spa sessions, leisurely walks, or cozy coffee dates.  
- **Explore & Socialize**  
  Medium-warm experiences such as street markets, gallery strolls, or casual meetups with friends.  
- **Focus & Learn**  
  Cooler-toned events for growth and productivity—workshops, lectures, or co-working pop-ups.  
- **Active & Energized (Coolest)**  
  High-energy pursuits like sports games, fitness classes, or dance nights.

## Visualizing Your Month with a Heat Map

On the **Month View**, each day is shaded according to your planned or suggested mood mix.  
- **Warm hues** indicate more relaxation or social time.  
- **Cool hues** show days heavy on learning or high-energy activities.  
- Mixed days blend colors to reflect balanced schedules.

This at-a-glance view helps you spot when you’re overdue for downtime or have room to add more adventure.

## How Moods Guide Discovery

1. **Filter by Mood**  
   Slide the mood selector to show only events matching your desired energy level.  
2. **Dynamic Adjustments**  
   As you add events, the heat map and daily mood totals update in real time.  
3. **Well-Being Insights**  
   Periodic summaries can nudge you to rebalance—e.g., “You’ve planned four high-energy days in a row; consider a chill activity next.”

## Building Healthier, Happier Calendars

By framing event suggestions in terms of how they make you feel, we turn planning into a personalized wellness tool. Whether you need a calm Sunday or a pump-up Saturday, your mood map has you covered.
