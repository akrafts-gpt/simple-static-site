# Smart Suggestions: Personalization & Chained Event Recommendations

Delivering the right events at the right time takes more than a simple list—it requires intelligent ranking, personalized filtering, and context-aware sequencing. In this article, we break down how our app transforms raw event data into curated, dynamic suggestions.

## Ranking & Filtering Basics

- **Popularity Signals**  
  Events with high community upvotes or attendance history get a visibility boost.  
- **Recency & Relevance**  
  Freshly added or upcoming events are prioritized, ensuring you don’t miss out.  
- **Category & Mood Matching**  
  Filters narrow suggestions to match your selected mood spectrum (e.g., Relax, Explore, Focus, Energize).

## Location-Aware Recommendations

- **Proximity Weighting**  
  Nearby events surface first, with distance factored into the ranking score.  
- **Geographic Clustering**  
  Suggest event “clusters” (e.g., a trio of activities downtown) to minimize travel time and increase convenience.

## Behavior-Driven Personalization

- **Swipe Data & History**  
  Every swipe, tap, and save refines your profile, tuning future suggestions to your tastes.  
- **Temporal Patterns**  
  The system learns your preferred time windows (e.g., Fri 6–9 pm) and prioritizes events that fit.

## Chaining Logic: Building Seamless Itineraries

1. **Seed Event Selection**  
   User selects a primary event (e.g., evening concert).  
2. **Related Activity Suggestions**  
   Immediately recommend pre- or post-event options—dinner spots, after-parties, or scenic walks.  
3. **Adaptive Chains**  
   If the user adds a chaining suggestion, the system extends the sequence (e.g., coffee + art exhibit + live show).

## Example Flow: A Friday Night Out

1. **Initial Swipe:** Concert at 8 pm in the Old Town.  
2. **Pre-Event Suggestion:** “Tapas bar 10 min away” → user adds it.  
3. **Post-Event Suggestion:** “Late-night jazz at 11 pm” → user dismisses.  
4. **Alternate Post-Event:** “Moonlit harbor walk” → user adds.  

The result is a ready-made itinerary: tapas, concert, and a scenic walk—all laid out on your calendar with one tap each.
