## 1 | Why Pricing Matters More Than Features
Local businesses run on razor-thin margins and deep scepticism of “SaaS creep.”  
The wrong pricing model will kill adoption faster than a broken PDF menu.  
See **Do You Really Need a Website?** for proof that many owners still hesitate to pay for *any* web presence.

## 2 | Freemium Philosophy: Three Non-Negotiables

1. **Always-Free Core**  
   * Business name, hours, menu/services, one booking link, and HTTPS hosting must remain free forever.  
   * Matches the baseline “PDF menu” cost (zero) described in **PDF Menus → Microsites**.

2. **No Third-Party Ads**  
   * We will never inject unrelated banners or competitor links.  
   * Builds trust compared with ad-stuffed “free site builders” called out in **Where Bad Sites Come From**.

3. **Transparent Upgrade Triggers**  
   * Usage limits and overages shown in-app, not buried in email.  
   * Prevents dark-pattern surprises that damage brand goodwill.

## 3 | Pricing Tiers at a Glance

| Tier | Monthly Price | What You Get | Upgrade Cue |
|------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Free** | €0 | Instant Site • 100 menu items • 1,000 monthly visits • Platform footer badge | Hits 1,000 visits or 50 bookings |
| **Starter** | €12 | Remove badge • Custom domain • Basic analytics • 3 Time-Slot offers | Tops 5,000 visits or wants booking deposits |
| **Growth** | €39 | Loyalty QR • Advanced analytics • A/B banner tests • Overlay pinning | Needs cross-promo marketplace access |
| **Pro** | €99 or 2 % GMV | API, headless export, multi-location dashboard, SLA | Expands to ≥5 locations or >€10 k GMV |

All limits are hard ceilings, never hidden soft caps.  
Upgrade prompts follow the visual meter style shown in **Curating Google Maps Listings**.

## 4 | Ethical Revenue Drivers (No Dark Patterns)

* **Soft-Gate Features** – Lock advanced *add-ons*, not core data.  
* **Grace Period** – Owners have 30 days to downgrade without losing data.  
* **No Credit-Card Wall** – Free tier requires only Google OAuth verification.  
* **Local-Currency Billing** – Eliminates FX fees for EU micro-merchants.  
* **Usage Emails, Not Alarms** – Friendly nudges at 80 % of quota, never sudden cut-offs.

## 5 | Cost Structure Behind the Scenes

| Cost Driver | Variable Cost per Unit | Scaling Strategy |
|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| CDN traffic | €0.06 per GB | Image WebP conversion drops payload 35 % |
| AI tokens | €0.002 per new microsite | First rewrite only; edits reuse cache |
| Places API | €0.003 per refresh | 2-tier cache (see **AI-Generated Instant Sites**) saves 42 % calls |
| Support tickets | €3.50 per ticket avg. | Community forum for Free/Starter |

Free tier is sustainable because AI and CDN costs are one-off or near-zero for low-traffic sites.

## 6 | Upgrade Triggers in Detail

* **Traffic Ceiling** – Visits counted by server logs, privacy-safe; meter resets monthly.  
* **Booking Volume** – 50 free bookings then €0.10 each or move to Starter.  
* **Time-Slot Deals** – Only 3 active deals on Free; power users move up (see **Time-Slot Deals for Any Business**).  
* **Marketplace Placement** – Businesses appear in discovery carousel (**The Microsite Flywheel**) only from Starter up; drives organic demand that offsets the fee.

## 7 | Competitor Comparison

| Feature | Our Free | Wix Free | Google Site | Linktree | DIY PDF |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Mobile speed | 95+ | 70 | 80 | 85 | 20 |
| Structured menu schema | Yes | No | No | N/A | No |
| Booking link | Yes | Third-party | No | No | No |
| Ads | None | Wix ads | None | Heavy | None |
| SSL | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

The no-ads stance and live schema give us a strategic wedge, building trust lacking in other freemium tools.

## 8 | Real-World ROI

| Business | Tier | Monthly Fee | Incremental Monthly Revenue | ROI |
|----------|------|-------------|-----------------------------|-----|
| ClipJoint Barbers | Starter | €12 | +€310 from weekday slots | 25× |
| Bella Roma Pizzeria | Growth | €39 | +€740 direct bookings | 19× |

## 9 | Churn-Reduction Playbook

* **Value Milestones** – Auto-email “You gained 100 bookings!” moments.  
* **Seasonal Boosts** – Temporary Growth-features unlock during holidays to let owners taste upsides.  
* **Exit Survey** – Simple dropdown; collect feature gaps for **Roadmap & Next Steps** prioritisation.  
* **One-Click Downgrade** – Protects reputation; many return within 90 days.

---

## 10 | Governance & Transparency

* **Quarterly Pricing Review** – Public changelog; no silent price hikes.  
* **Revenue Share for Referrers** – 20 % of first-year fees to partner agencies.  
* **Open-Source Templates** – Base theme code on GitHub; aligns with community trust.  
* **Impact Report** – Annual disclosure of SMB savings vs. legacy 30 % aggregator fees.

---

## 11 | Key Take-Aways

1. Freemium works only when **core functionality is genuinely free** and ad-free.  
2. Upgrade nudges should align with *success events*—traffic spikes, bookings, or marketplace leads.  
3. Transparent costs and ethical guardrails build long-term trust, unlike many DIY builders called out in **Where Bad Sites Come From**.  
4. A robust free tier fuels the **Microsite Flywheel**, which in turn drives paid conversions without predatory tactics.
