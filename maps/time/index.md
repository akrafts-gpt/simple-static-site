## 1 | Why Time-Based Discounts Matter Everywhere
Restaurants use **The Fork** to sell tables at –30 % on quiet Tuesdays. Cafés push surplus croissants on **Too Good To Go**. But the same demand-smoothing principle works for:

| Sector | Peak vs. Valley | Unsold “Inventory” |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Barbershops** | Sat 10 am vs. Tue 2 pm | Empty chairs, paid staff idle |
| **Dentists** | Evenings vs. weekday mornings | Unused operatory time |
| **Yoga Studios** | 6 pm after-work vs. mid-afternoon | Half-empty classes |
| **Retail Boutiques** | Weekends vs. Mon/Tue | Stale seasonal stock |

If you’re still wondering *whether you even need a web layer* to run these offers, hop to **[Do You Really Need a Website?](../why/)** first.

## 2 | Core Mechanics of a Time-Slot Deal Engine
1. **Inventory Model** — Define a quantifiable slot (chair-hour, class seat, SKU batch).  
2. **Dynamic Pricing** — X % off when predicted fill rate < target.  
3. **Real-Time Publishing** — Push to Maps overlay + microsite banner (see **[Curating Google Maps Listings](../curate/)**).  
4. **Auto-Expiry** — Deal disappears once slot is booked or window closes.  
5. **Data Loop** — Track redemption, repeat rate, margin delta.

> **Pro-tip:** Keep discount depth shallow (10–20 %) for services, deeper (30-50 %) for true perishables.

## 4 | Technology Stack Snapshot
| Layer | Tooling | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **Scheduler API** | Cron + capacity model | Per service type |

## 5 | Financial Impact Model
**Example: Three-Chair Barbershop**

| Metric | Baseline | With Time-Slot Engine |
|--------|----------|-----------------------|
| Avg. weekday seat fill | 55 % | 78 % |
| Avg. ticket (w/ discount) | €22 | €19 |
| Net daily revenue | €363 | €445 (+23 %) |
| New-customer ratio | 12 % | 34 % |

The lifetime value of those new customers then compounds—captured in your **Microsite Flywheel KPIs**.

## 9 | Common Pitfalls & How to Dodge Them

| Pitfall | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| **Discount Cannibalisation** | Limit discounted slots to ≤ 20 % of daily capacity |
| **No-Show Spike** | Charge a small deposit (e.g. €5); auto-refund on arrival |
| **Staff Confusion** | Colour-code discounted bookings in the POS/calendar |
| **Review Backfire** | Trigger post-visit NPS survey; route low scores to private channel first |

## 10 | Compliance & Ethical Notes

* **Price Transparency** – Display regular and discounted prices side-by-side (EU consumer law).  
* **Healthcare Caveats** – Ensure dental/medical offers comply with local insurance regulations.  
* **No “Bait & Switch”** – Once published, honour the discount until the slot is sold or expires.

## 11 | Future Extensions

1. **Dynamic Bundles** – Pair a slow-hour massage with a neighbouring café’s pastry voucher.  
2. **Surge *Premium* Pricing** – Flip the model: raise prices for peak-demand slots.  
3. **AI Demand Forecasting** – Pull weather/event data to pre-set discounts (slated in “[Roadmap & Next Steps](../next/)”).

## 12 | Key Take-Aways

1. Idle time is perishable—treat it like unsold food.  
2. A flexible time-slot engine works across **services, retail, and healthcare**.  
3. Maps overlay + microsite convert last-minute browsers into booked customers.  
4. Start with a pilot, measure, iterate—then let the **Microsite Flywheel** amplify reach.
