1. Context & Core Concept
	•	Mission: Help local businesses (cafés, barbers, bakeries, small hotels, etc.) look great to customers who discover them on Google Maps or social channels.
	•	Guiding idea: Most locals don’t need full custom sites or dedicated mobile apps; they need a lightweight, always-updated, mobile-friendly landing experience that fills the gaps Maps and social media leave open.

⸻

2. Problems Identified

2.1. Poor Web Presence
	•	Many local businesses still run outdated, hard-to-use sites (often supplied by cheap freelancers or the owner’s acquaintance).
	•	Others skip a site altogether, linking to a PDF menu in Google Drive or similar stopgaps.
	•	Owners rarely have time, budget, or skills to maintain sites.

2.2. Google Maps “Wild West”
	•	Crowdsourced chaos: random visitor photos, irrelevant or ancient reviews, menu items/prices from years ago.
	•	No simple way for owners to curate the feed or spotlight what matters today.
	•	For high-traffic tourist spots the signal-to-noise ratio is terrible.

2.3. Platform Gaps for Conversion
	•	Google Maps & social apps lack:
	•	Booking / reservation flows
	•	Time-slot-based discounts (à la The Fork)
	•	Inventory-clearance flash sales (à la Too Good To Go/Karma)
	•	Cross-industry promotions (barbers, retail, dentists, etc.)

3. Market Research — Where Today’s Bad Sites Come From

Source	Typical Tools / Traits	Quality Issues
DIY Site Builders (Wix, Jimdo, Hostinger, SiteW, etc.)	Drag-and-drop templates; owner does it all	Generic look, inconsistent branding, poor SEO
Freelancers	WordPress/Joomla installs, cheap themes	Varies wildly; updates often neglected
Small Digital Agencies	Offer “all-in-one” bundles	OK design, but costly for micro-SMBs; locked-in hosting
Business-directory spin-offs	Yalwa, small local portals	Extremely basic single-page presence
No site (PDF / Google Doc)	Menu or price-list only	Zero interactivity or analytics


⸻

4. Proposed Solution Suite

4.1. Google-Maps-First Websites
	•	Responsive, one-page sites that extend a Maps listing.
	•	Core modules: booking, contact + forms, menus/services, photo gallery, real-time specials ticker.
	•	“Add to Home Screen” guidance → app-like feel without an app.

4.2. Owner-Curated Overlay for Maps
	•	Browser extension / dashboard letting owners pin “official” photos & reviews, hide noise, and push highlights to the top of the listing.
	•	Visitors still access the raw Maps data if desired; overlay is optional.

4.3. AI-Generated “Instant Sites”
	1.	Scrape public Maps data (name, address, hours, reviews, photos).
	2.	LLM cleans, rewrites, and formats content into an attractive template.
	3.	Owner preview → one-click claim & customize.
	4.	Upsell to premium plan for custom domain, branding, SEO, payments.
