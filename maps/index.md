## 1 | The Big Idea — in 30 seconds  
Local cafés, barbers, bakeries and boutique hotels are found first on **Google Maps**, yet:

* Many still rely on clunky DIY sites or a lonely PDF menu.  
* Crowdsourced photos and reviews turn popular listings into a noisy “Wild West.”  
* Maps and social feeds don’t handle bookings, dynamic offers, or owner storytelling.

**Our platform** adds a light, owner-controlled layer on top:  
1. **Instant, mobile microsite** generated from existing Maps data.  
2. **Curated overlay** that pins the best photos & reviews, hiding the junk.  
3. **Deal engine** that fills off-peak slots and promotes cross-business bundles.

If that already makes sense, jump straight to *[AI-Generated Instant Sites](ai/)*.
