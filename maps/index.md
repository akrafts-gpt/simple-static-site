# Google-Maps-First Presence for Local Businesses  
*A concise gateway page that links you to each in-depth article in the series.*

Local cafés, barbers, bakeries, and boutique hotels are discovered first on **Google Maps**—not on their websites. Yet Maps alone can’t showcase current menus, take bookings, or weed out outdated photos. Our platform fills that gap with three layers:

1. **Instant microsites** generated from existing Maps data.  
2. **An owner-curated overlay** that cleans up the “Wild West” of crowdsourced content.  
3. **A deal engine** that drives off-peak traffic and cross-business bundles.

Dive into the sections below for a quick overview, then follow the links to the sub-articles for full details.
