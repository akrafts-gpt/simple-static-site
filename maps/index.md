## 1. Context & Core Concept
**Mission:** help small, place-based businesses shine where customers already see them—on Google Maps.  
**Key idea:** most neighbourhood venues don’t need a heavyweight site or app; a **fast microsite** (see <https://example.com/ai/>) plus a curated Maps layer does the job.

---

## 2. Problems Identified
### 2.1. Poor Web Presence
Many owners rely on decade-old DIY pages or a lonely PDF menu. The full autopsy is in **[Where Bad Sites Come From](when/)**.

### 2.2. Google Maps “Wild West”
Random visitor photos and legacy reviews make listings messy. How we tame that chaos is covered in **[Taming the Google Maps Wild West](wild/)**.

### 2.3. Platform Gaps for Conversion
Maps gives directions but no booking, no loyalty, no discounts—gaps we close with the deal engine explained in **[Time-Slot Deals for Any Business](time/)**.

---

## 3. Market Research — Where Today’s Bad Sites Come From
DIY builders, vanishing freelancers, agency lock-ins, and the ever-popular “just upload a PDF.” If you recognise yourself, read **[Where Bad Sites Come From](when/)** for exit strategies.

---

## 4. Proposed Solution Suite
### 4.1. Google-Maps-First Websites
Lightning-fast one-pagers that load in <1 s and work as installable PWAs. Full build flow in **[AI-Generated Instant Sites](ai/)**.

### 4.2. Owner-Curated Overlay for Maps
Pin best photos, highlight chosen reviews, and run live banners—details in **[Curating Google Maps Listings](curate/)**.

### 4.3. AI-Generated “Instant Sites”
Import Maps data → clean with AI → publish. A 10-minute walkthrough lives in **[AI-Generated Instant Sites](ai/)**.

---

## 5. Cross-Business Promotion & Dynamic Offers
Off-peak discounts, surplus flash sales, and neighbour bundles all ride on our deal engine (see **[Time-Slot Deals for Any Business](time/)**) and feed the discovery loop described in **[The Microsite Flywheel](fly/)**.

---

## 6. Business Model & Pricing
Transparent freemium: a generous free tier, then upgrade only when traffic or bookings justify it. Philosophy and numbers in **[A Freemium Model Owners Trust](price/)**.

---

## 7. Benefits by Stakeholder
* **Owners:** zero-code site, curated listing, more bookings.  
* **Customers:** up-to-date info, easy reservations, relevant deals.  
* **Platform:** fair, ad-free revenue that scales with owner success.

## 8. Future Enhancements
Integrated payments, real-time analytics, social-media auto-sync, AI review spam filter, and AR way-finding—all tracked publicly in **[Roadmap & Next Steps](next/)**.
