## 1. Context & Core Concept
**Mission:** help small, place-based businesses look great to the customers who already find them on Google Maps.  
**Key idea:** most neighbourhood venues do **not** need a heavy website or a custom app—just a lightning-fast, mobile-ready landing page that fills the gaps Maps and social media leave open.

---

## 2. Problems Identified
### 2.1. Poor Web Presence
* Many owners still rely on decade-old DIY pages or single-page PDFs.  
* Lack of time, skill, and budget keeps those sites frozen in time.

### 2.2. Google Maps “Wild West”
* Anyone can post photos or reviews; signal is mixed with a lot of noise.  
* Out-of-date menus and legacy 1-star reviews scare new guests away.

### 2.3. Platform Gaps for Conversion
* Maps offers directions and a phone number—nothing more.  
* No built-in booking, no off-peak discounts, no loyalty hooks.

---

## 3. Market Research — Where Today’s Bad Sites Come From
* **DIY builders** (Wix, Jimdo) → easy start, but heavy code and poor SEO.  
* **Marketplace freelancers** → low-cost themes, no maintenance contract.  
* **Local “friend who codes”** → enthusiasm fades; site rots.  
* **Small agencies** → decent design but pricey and often locked to their hosting.  
* **No site at all** → a Google Doc or PDF menu; zero analytics, awkward on phones.

## 4. Proposed Solution Suite
### 4.1. Google-Maps-First Websites
A single, responsive page that loads in <1 s, carries structured menu data, and can be “added to Home Screen” like an app.

### 4.2. Owner-Curated Overlay for Maps
A light overlay that pins the best photos and reviews, hides junk, and shows live banners—without touching Google’s DOM.

### 4.3. AI-Generated “Instant Sites”
1. Import public Maps data.  
2. Clean with AI (drop blurry pics, rewrite reviews).  
3. Auto-layout into a branded template.  
4. Owner tweaks, then publishes with one click.

---

## 5. Cross-Business Promotion & Dynamic Offers
* **Off-peak discounts** (inspired by The Fork) fill empty chairs on slow days.  
* **Surplus flash sales** (Too Good To Go style) clear perishables or stale stock.  
* **Neighbour bundles** let two or three nearby venues sell a combo experience.

---

## 6. Business Model & Pricing
* **Free** – core microsite, HTTPS, booking button, small footer badge.  
* **Starter** – remove badge, add custom domain + basic analytics.  
* **Growth** – loyalty QR, advanced analytics, unlimited deals.  
* **Pro** – API, headless export, multi-location dashboard.  
All tiers are ad-free; upgrade prompts appear only when usage caps are truly hit.

---

## 7. Benefits by Stakeholder
* **Owners:** zero-code site, curated Maps presence, higher conversion.  
* **Customers:** accurate info, instant reservations, relevant offers.  
* **Platform:** sustainable freemium revenue and richer local discovery data.

---

## 8. Future Enhancements
* Integrated payments & deposits  
* Real-time analytics dashboard  
* Social-media auto-sync  
* AI review-spam filter  
* AR way-finding and multi-location API (see Roadmap sub-article)
