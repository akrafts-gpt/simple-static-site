## 1. Context & Core Concept
- **Mission**: Help local businesses (cafés, barbers, bakeries, small hotels, etc.) look great to customers who discover them on **Google Maps** or social channels.  
- **Guiding idea**: Most locals don’t need full custom sites or dedicated mobile apps; they need a lightweight, always-updated, mobile-friendly landing experience that fills the gaps Maps and social media leave open.

---

## 2. Problems Identified
### 2.1. Poor Web Presence
- Many locals still run **outdated, hard-to-use sites** (often supplied by cheap freelancers or friends).  
- Others skip sites altogether, linking to a **PDF menu** or Google Doc.  
- Owners rarely have time, budget, or skills to maintain sites.

### 2.2. Google Maps “Wild West”
- **Crowdsourced chaos**: random visitor photos, irrelevant or ancient reviews, wrong menus/prices.  
- No simple way for owners to curate or spotlight what matters *today*.  
- High-traffic tourist spots suffer worst signal-to-noise.

### 2.3. Platform Gaps for Conversion
- Google Maps & social apps lack:
  - Booking / reservation flows  
  - Time-slot discounts (à la **The Fork**)  
  - Flash-sale surplus clearing (à la **Too Good To Go** / **Karma**)  
  - Cross-industry promos (barbers, retail, dentists…)

## 4. Proposed Solution Suite
### 4.1. Google-Maps-First Websites
- **Responsive one-pagers** extending a Maps listing.  
- Modules: booking, contact forms, menus/services, gallery, live specials.  
- **“Add to Home Screen”** → app-like feel without an app.

### 4.2. Owner-Curated Overlay for Maps
- Dashboard lets owners **pin official photos & reviews**, hide noise, push highlights.  
- Raw Maps data still available; overlay is optional.

### 4.3. AI-Generated “Instant Sites”
1. Scrape public Maps data (name, hours, reviews, photos).  
2. LLM cleans & formats into attractive template.  
3. Owner preview → one-click claim & edit.  
4. Upsell for custom domain, branding, SEO, payments.
