# Google-Maps-First Presence for Local Businesses  
*A modern approach to help neighbourhood venues turn Google-Maps clicks into real-world customers.*

Most cafés, barbers, bakeries, and boutique hotels are **found first on Google Maps**, yet the platform alone cannot:

* Show a live, readable menu or service list  
* Take bookings or sell off-peak discounts  
* Filter out outdated photos and legacy 1-star reviews  

Our solution adds three lightweight layers:

1. **Instant microsites** built automatically from existing Maps data.  
2. **An owner-curated overlay** that highlights the right photos and reviews directly inside the Maps listing.  
3. **A deal engine** that fills slow hours and promotes cross-business bundles—without requiring a custom app or heavy website.

Below is a quick overview; each bullet links to a dedicated article with deeper detail.
