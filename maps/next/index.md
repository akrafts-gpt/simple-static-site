## 1 | Why Publish a Public Roadmap?
* **Trust through transparency** – Owners know we will not rug-pull on pricing or features (see *A Freemium Model Owners Trust*).  
* **Partner alignment** – Agencies, POS vendors, and tourism boards can build on predictable release cycles.  
* **Community feedback loop** – Early adopters upvote priorities, preventing ivory-tower features.

## 4 | 2027 Moon-Shot Initiatives

| Initiative | What It Is | Dependency |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **AR Way-finding Layer** | Live-view arrows from Maps to store; overlay surfaces in-route promos | Google ARCore APIs |
| **Zero-Party Data Marketplace** | Users volunteer preferences (vegan, wheelchair access) for personalised carousels | GDPR consent vault |
| **Smart Bundle Generator** | LLM designs cross-business itineraries (e.g., “Rainy Sunday Plan”) | Complete Flywheel dataset |
| **Carbon Footprint Badges** | Auto-calculate kg CO₂ per product, display on menu | Supply-chain API partners |

These forward-looking bets depend on hitting the 2026 targets first.

## 5 | Governance & Versioning

* Semantic versioning: **v YY.MM** (e.g., v 25.10).  
* **Feature flags** – Owners can opt-in per site; avoids forced surprises.  
* Quarterly public roadmap update with “shipped / on-track / at-risk” tags.  
* Community board (powered by Loomio) to vote on candidate features.

## 6 | Risk Register (Top 3)

| Risk | Mitigation | Impacted Articles |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| Google API pricing changes | Maintain edge cache, explore MapKit JS fallback | Taming the Google Maps Wild West |
| Data-protection regulation shifts | DPA updates, data-residency zones per EU state | A Freemium Model Owners Trust |
| Feature creep bloating bundle size | Performance budget enforced in CI, fail build on >150 KB JS | Where Bad Sites Come From |

## 7 | How Owners Can Influence the Roadmap

1. Up-vote feature cards in the dashboard.  
2. Comment threads on each item (GitHub Discussions mirror for transparency).  
3. Early-access program: test beta features in exchange for metrics sharing.  
4. Quarterly town-hall webinar recapping what shipped.

*Participatory governance echoes our ethos in **A Freemium Model Owners Trust***.

## 9 | Key Take-Aways

1. The roadmap focuses first on **chain scalability**, then **smart revenue tools**, finally **immersive UX**.  
2. Every upcoming feature ties back to at least one existing pillar: microsites, overlay, or deals.  
3. Transparent milestones, open voting, and hard performance budgets keep the platform aligned with SMB realities highlighted in earlier articles.  
4. Owners who start with **AI-Generated Instant Sites** today will automatically inherit these upgrades—many free under the commitments in **A Freemium Model Owners Trust**.
