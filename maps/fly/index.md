## 1 | What Is the Microsite Flywheel?
A **flywheel** is a self-reinforcing loop: each spin adds momentum that drives the next.  
For local businesses, every owner-managed microsite (see **AI-Generated Instant Sites**) links into a **shared discovery marketplace**. Each new site:  

* Adds fresh, search-indexed content → improves overall SEO authority.  
* Surfaces cross-promotions → lifts redemption for neighbours’ deals.  
* Generates user data → refines recommendation algorithms, improving click-through.

Result: traffic and bookings compound—without paid ads.

## 2 | Three Components of the Flywheel

| Component | Role | Related Article |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **Owner Microsite** | Fast, structured landing page | AI-Generated Instant Sites |
| **Overlay Banners** | Pull live specials into Google Maps | Curating Google Maps Listings |
| **Marketplace Carousel** | Aggregates nearby offers & events | Time-Slot Deals for Any Business |

Each element can stand alone, but combined they accelerate one another.

## 3 | The Customer Journey

1. **Discovery** – User opens Google Maps, sees an overlay banner: “–20 % off 3 pm haircut.”  
2. **Click-through** – Banner links to the barber’s microsite; page loads in ~1 s.  
3. **Cross-Promo Swipe** – Carousel suggests “Free pastry with coffee next door.”  
4. **Bundle Checkout** – User books both offers; wallet pass issued.  
5. **Post-Visit Review** – Microsite thanks user, nudges 5-star review → feeds back into Maps ranking (see **Taming the Google Maps Wild West**).  
6. **Algorithm Learn** – Engine notes user likes pastry + grooming, boosts similar combos to next visitor profile.

Loops repeat, spinning faster as inventory and data grow.

## 4 | Network-Effect Math

| Metric | Formula | Typical Starting Value | Target @ 12 mo |
|--------|---------|------------------------|---------------|
| **N** = live microsites | — | 50 | 2 500 |
| **V** = avg. visits/site/mo | — | 600 | 1 200 |
| **CTR** = carousel clicks / visits | 6–10 % | 8 % | 14 % |
| **Bookings** = N × V × CTR × conv. 25 % | 600 | 42 000 |

More sites → more inventory → higher CTR → search engines crawl more frequently → better rankings → more sites join.

## 5 | Cross-Business Collaboration Patterns

### 5.1 Neighbour Bundles  
Barber + café within 150 m offer “Fade & Flat White” combo at 10 % off.

### 5.2 Theme Trails  
“Vegan Day Out” page auto-compiles six vegan-friendly microsites into a walkable map. Inspired by structured data described in **PDF Menus → Microsites**.

### 5.3 Seasonal Passports  
Holiday “Winter Warmers” pass unlocks three hot-drink vouchers across different cafés; tracked via single QR code.

Bundles appear in overlay banners and marketplace lists; eligibility rules live in the Growth tier (pricing in **A Freemium Model Owners Trust**).

## 6 | Owner On-Ramp (30-Day Playbook)

| Week | Action | Outcome |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Launch Instant Site, enable overlay | Baseline traffic +12 % |
| 2 | Add first Time-Slot Deal | Off-peak revenue bump |
| 3 | Join or create a neighbour bundle | Traffic from partner fans |
| 4 | Publish themed blog post via CMS | SEO lift, cross-links other microsites |

Touchpoints are automated via onboarding emails and dashboard wizards.

---

## 7 | Governance & Quality Control

* **Relevance Score** – AI ranks bundles by proximity, category, price parity.  
* **Duplicate Guard** – No site appears in >3 bundles to prevent spam.  
* **User Voting** – Consumers upvote helpful bundles; low-ranked ones auto-expire.  
* **Merchant Review** – Owners can opt out of appearing on competitor pages.

Policies mirror the ethical stance in **A Freemium Model Owners Trust**.

## 8 | Financial Upside

| Revenue Channel | Model | Example |
|-----------------|-------|---------|
| Booking fees | €0.10 per Free-tier booking | Barber chair slot |
| Subscription | Tier upgrades | Café moves to Growth for loyalty QR |
| Revenue share | 2 % affiliate on cross-promo sale | Boutique sells scarf via bundle |

Free-tier sites profit from incoming traffic; platform profits when they upgrade.

## 9 | Case Study – Lisbon “Pink Street Cluster”

* 7 microsites (3 bars, 2 restaurants, 1 tattoo studio, 1 hostel).  
* Shared “Pink Street Passport” (Friday 6-10 pm) launched Q2 2025.  
* **60-day results:**  
  * Collective footfall +27 % (vs. same period LY).  
  * Average spend per visitor €38 → €46.  
  * Two bars upgraded to Growth tier for analytics, confirming **Freemium Model** viability.

Data correlates with the uplift examples in **Time-Slot Deals for Any Business**.

## 10 | Potential Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Oversaturation (too many offers) | Algorithm caps offers per user per session |
| Partner disputes on bundle terms | Escrow system holds revenue until redemption logged |
| Cross-site SEO cannibalisation | Canonical tags reference primary site |
