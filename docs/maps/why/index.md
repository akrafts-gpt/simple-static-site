## 1. The “Full-Website Fallacy”

Local owners keep hearing:

> *“You must have a complete website and an app—otherwise you’ll lose customers!”*

Reality:  
- **70 – 80 %** of first-time discovery now happens inside Google Maps or social feeds (Meta, TikTok).  
- Only **~20 %** of those users ever click out to a stand-alone website.  
- Of that 20 %, half drop off in < 5 seconds if the site is slow or not mobile-ready.  

**Take-away:** a *massive* build is overkill, but *zero* presence hurts conversion.

## 2. What Gaps Does Google Maps Leave?

| Need | Maps Support | Conversion Risk |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| Live menus / service lists | ❌ Only static photos or user-added text | Guests see outdated prices |
| Time-slot booking | ❌ (unless 3rd-party integrated) | No-shows & lost revenue |
| The owner’s “story” | ❌ Buried in crowdsourced reviews | Brand dilution |

For a deep dive into that chaos, read **[Taming the Google Maps Wild West](../wild/)**.

## 3. Common “Quick Fixes” (and Their Traps)

### 3.1. PDF & Google-Doc Menus  
- **Pros:** fast, printable, free.  
- **Cons:** non-indexed by search, zero analytics, awkward on phones.  
- See how restaurants evolved in **[PDF Menus → Microsites](../pdf/)**.

### 3.2. DIY Builders (Wix, Jimdo)  
- **Pros:** cheap starter templates.  
- **Cons:** generic, slow, and owners rarely update them.

### 3.3. No Site at All  
- **Pros:** none to build.  
- **Cons:** Maps link looks broken; trust plummets.

## 4. When *Do* You Need More Than a Microsite?

| Question | If “Yes,” Consider Full Site |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| Do you sell > 20 SKUs online? | e-commerce checkout, inventory sync |
| Do you run frequent long-form blogs or events? | content CMS |
| Do you need multi-language deep content? | custom architecture |

Otherwise, a **fast, mobile-first microsite** is enough.

## 5. The Microsite Sweet Spot

A one-page site that:

1. **Extends** Maps data (hours, address) with dynamic sections (menus, booking, coupons).  
2. Loads in **< 1 second** on 3G.  
3. Can be **added to the home screen** like an app.  
4. Costs almost nothing to maintain.

See how we auto-generate one in **[AI-Generated Instant Sites](../ai/)**.

## 6. Decision Checklist

- [ ] Has my Maps listing converted < 2 % of profile views into visits last month?  
- [ ] Do I rely on time-slot utilization (e.g., off-peak barber seats)? => Pair with **[Time-Slot Deals for Any Business](../time/)**.  
- [ ] Is my “website” currently a PDF?  
- [ ] Am I paying $$ for a site I never update?  

If you tick one or more boxes, **start with a microsite** and grow only when the data proves you need more.
